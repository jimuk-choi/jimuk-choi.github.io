Using a location-based app, sales agents can now automatically log their tasks in real-time without needing to return to the office. This allows for seamless task management on the go, while managers can easily oversee the activities of their sales teams. In this project, I was responsible for UI/UX design and publishing, creating a user-friendly interface and improving the overall user experience."
